          Why should organizations be required to disclose their political
          advertisements?
        </b>
        <br />
        The unregulated state of our campaign finance system and the
        proliferation of similarly unregulated digital platforms is a dangerous
        combination, especially considering the well-documented existence of
        foreign interference in our elections. This bill requires organizations
        to disclose the details of their purchase. This will increase
        transparency in our electoral processes, and dissuade foreign actors.
