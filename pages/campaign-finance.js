          Why do we need to amend the Consitution for campaign finance
          regulation?
        </b>
        <br />
        Due to Citizen’s United, our campaign finance systems are substantially
        unregulated. This has empowered the voices of a select few, allowed
        untraceable advertisements to circulate, and corroded the ability of the
        people to govern themselves. This bill calls on our Federal Congress to
        propose an amendment to the Constitution to overturn the Citizen’s
        United decision, so States may regulate campaign finance systems. If a
        bill is not amendment is not proposed within 6 months, Massachusetts
        will be the 6th state to call for a Constitutional Convention to propose
        the amendment.
