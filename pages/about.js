      <p>
        <b>The Good Governance Project</b> was founded through a partnership
        with BCâ€™s Clough Center for Constitutional Democracy. The Project
        consists of issue-specific Working Groups tackling non-partisan
        democracy reforms (ranked-choice voting, campaign finance,
        gerrymandering, etc.). We want to empower and channel student energy on
        critical democracy reform issues.
        <br />
        <br />
        In the Fall, Working Groups explore issues and weigh solutions. They
        spend the remainder of the school year aggregating the student voice to
        advance specific legislative action.
        <br />
        <br />
        The GGP Leadership Team is tasked with creating a framework for Working
        Groups, so that they can effectively learn about common ground issues in
        our political system, identify a specific solution and advocate for it.
        The Leadership Team provides networks, technology, and structures to
        help gather support from diverse, interdisciplinary student and
        constituent groups, faculty and state politicians.
        <br />
        <br />
        We believe that the rules that govern our political systems can and
        should be improved so that they provide better results for the public
        interest.
