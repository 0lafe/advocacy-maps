title:  "Faith in Democracy"
---
Our democracy requires faith – it requires us to trust. Trust is earned, and it is quickly lost. Our government does not have the faith required to operate effectively – to make decisions for the public good. It is a symbiotic problem: our government cannot effectively govern without the people’s consent; the people cannot give their consent to such an innefficient system. We have an information problem – ironic, in the digital age. There is too much information, and not enough trust.
